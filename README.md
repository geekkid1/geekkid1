Hi, I'm @geekkid1. You probably don't know me from anything in particular. Contact me for work inquiries, I specialize in Python and have pricing set up for discord utility bots. There should be contact methods placed elsewhere on my profile.

I hope you enjoy reading the code that I have written, and using it if you wish, of course. Have fun!
