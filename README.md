Hi, I'm @geekkid1. You probably don't know me from anything in particular. Contact me for work inquiries, I specialize in Python and have pricing set up for discord utility bots. There should be contact methods placed elsewhere on my profile.

I hope you enjoy reading the code that I have written, and using it if you wish, of course. Have fun!

The images below are generated using [anuraghazra's github-readme-stats repository](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). Use it yourself if you like, it's super easy to use and it's a really cool set of assets that you can use to embed on your profile and add that kind of cool flair to it.
